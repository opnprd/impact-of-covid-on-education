# Impact of COVID-19 on Education in the UK

This repository holds a visualisation of the data analysis conducted during a brief research study
into the impact of COVID-19 on the UK education sector.

The data in the repository is currently synthetic to enable the development of visualisations
and to understand the shape of the data.

## Developing and building

The site is a single page app built which uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

To set up locally you'll need to run `npm install`;

To run locally in a livereload dev style,

```
npm start dev
```

This should automatically reload when the underlying files change.
